# Found an Issue?

That's great, thanks for reporting it! If this looks like a possible bug in
zoom-vanilla.js, it would be super helpful if you could create a sample on
CodePen to help me reproduce it.

[Here is a template pen][template] that includes the necessary CSS and JS along
with a sample image. Please fork it in a way that demonstrates the issue, and
paste the link in the issue description.
